## Github Actions/Pipeline
In this exercise, the github actions/pipeline tool was firstly tested out. The Simple_calculator.py code was tested by a linter to
get a rating of the code so it's easier to improve it.

## How to
To do this exercise, add "pylint" linter to your project workflows. It's done in the "Actions" tab by searching for pylint from all the available workflows and then adding it. Afterwards, the Simple_calculator.py file is added into repository so the pylint triggers and 
then the analyzing happens.

## Result
